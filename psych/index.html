          I believe that the main human characters of the movie don't represent a particular thing or idea. Instead they all show different concepts or themes related to child development. Throughout the movie we see Max go through a number of
          character changes, along with seeing him move through Ericksons model on child development. Max starts in an early childhood mindset of initiative vs. guilt, where family is important, and where a major thing kids do is explore. This
          is exemplified by Max's exploration of the island throughout the movie and his desire to keep learning new things. When Max and the Wild Things are in a pile and Max is talking to KW, she comments, "You ask a lot of questions",
          showing some of Max's curiosity. The next stage we see Max in is middle childhood, where a major theme is school. We don't see much of Max acting in this stage. We only see him in a classroom for one scene, where he learns that the
          sun will die and not everything lasts forever. The last major stage we see Max start to go through is adoolescence. Mainly, we see Max struggle to determine exactly how he should act and who he is. Towards the beginning of the movei,
          Max says "they think I'm a bad person...I don't know". However as themovei progresses we see Max gain a sense of identity. In the end, when asked by Carol "What are you?", Max replies "I'm Max". Throughout the movie, Max shows the
          different stages of Erickson's theory on child development.</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">

          I believe that Carol is one representation of Max on the island. Carol represents Max towards the start of the movie, the more anger/emotionally driven irrational side of him. At the beginning, when Max arrives to the island we see Carol
          destorying houses, very similar to how Max destroyed his sisters room. We also see Carol interact with his Wild Thing family much in the same way Max interacted with ihs own family. One example is a parallel drawn between kW and Max's
          sister. Carol is mad at KW for spenidng so much time with her friends, which is why he destroys their homes. Similarly, Max get's mad at his sister because her and her friends iddn't want to hang out with him. As a result he destroys her
          room. Another thing the two have in common is in some of the things they say. The movie does a good job of making it very obvious the two are linked, for example having Carol tell a story about teeth falling out that is very similar to the
          one Max told his mom. There are multiple other examples like this throughout the movie. Carol gives Max a way to see how he affects others, due to their similiarity. Carol gives Max a lok at himself that he otherwise never would have had.

          <p>Alexander was a harder character to come up with a representation for. One possible conclusion is that he represents a different part of Max. Whereas Carol is the very irrational, outspoken, and emotional side of Max, Alexander is the
            shy, more quiet, scared side of Max. This is first shown in a comment towards the beginning of the movei, where Alexanders says quietly "Does anbody ever hear me?", showing Alexander as too scared to speak up for himself and quiet. This
            is sort of reminiscent of how Max seemed to be in class, quiet and scared of what his teacher was saying. It's almost as if Alexander represents what Max thinks he should bel ike whereas Carol represents what Max is really like. Alexander
            is also shown to be pretty smart in how he deduced that Max "[isn't] really a king [he's] just regular". The biggest reason I think Alexander is really another aspect of Max is his positioning at the end. Alexander stands with Ira, KW,
            and Judith, all of which I believe also represent real people. This leads me to belive that Alexander <i>also</i> represents a real person. Also at the very end, Judith puts her arm around Alexander in a caring way, ismilar to how a
            mother wraps her arm around a child. Alexander also shows finidng fault in authority figures when he realizes that Max isn't a king.</p>

          Max's sister shows the more older side of child development. She obviously doesn't like to listen to her mother, shown when she ignores her moms request to come set teh table. She also seems to have little relationship with Max in the sense
          that she doesn't hang with him as much as her own friends. One of the phases on Erickson's model has to do with friends and social groups at around the age Max's sister appears to be. Another major part of Max's sister is how she spends
          more
          time with her friends than Max. Max also doesn't understand her friends and how they act or why his sister like them so much. This is important in shwing the ocnnection between the sister and KW</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          KW sometimes acts like a mom in the beginning. However, as teh movie progresses, it becomes increasilngly clear that KW is a representaiton of the sister. The first proof of this is how both spend tiem with their friends. Carol really
          doesn't like that KW spends more time with her riends than with him, and Max is the same way with his sister. When KW introduces Max and Carol to these friends, neither Max nor Carol understands them. This directly connnects to how Max
          doesn't understnad his sister's friends. The last major reason I believe KW to be a representation of the sister is due to her positioning at the end. She is with Ira, Judith, and Alexander, who I blieve represent the real people in Max's
          life.

          The Mom exemplifies the parenting styles shown in the movie. In the beginning, she is shown to be a very busy person, telling Max, "I would've done something" about the sister's friends breaking his fort. She is clearly not always there for
          Max when he needs it as a developing child. Her investment into work is later shown when Max does a robot dance for her while she's on the computer, presumably working. Her attitued at this point in the movie to me shows a little neglect.
          The next major scene with her is the dinner scene when Max runs away. Here she shows aggressiveness, yelling at Max to get off the table, which ends up causing Max to fight/talk back. In this scene she is very clearly more focused on her
          date than Max, which is a part of what causes Max to act out. The Mom also shows a lot of regret and feels sorry after she causes Max to run away. At the end of the movie, even without dialogue, you can tell by the look on her face that she
          is sorry. She rightly blames herself for Max running away. In the very last part she falls asleep, finally knowing that Max is safe at home. Her reaction to Max running away and his return shows a very protective and worried parenting
          style, who just wants to keep their kids safe.</div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          Judith very obviously represents the Mom. Judith is the other of two girls on the island, and the Mom and Sister (who appears to be connected to KW) are the two girls in Max's life. In the beginning it is mentioned that she and Ira are
          in love, which is likely representative of the Moms relationship with the boyfriend. Both characters are even played by the same actor, which sohws that even the director/caster wanted to draw the connection between them. One scene that
          draws similarity is when they are choosing teams for the dirtball fight. Max chooses both Judith and Ira to be bad guys. This is likely due to Max putting his mother on the bad side when he went against her and left home. The mom also
          didn't help Max in his snowball fight, so Judith not helping during the dirtball fight shows further similarity. Another scene that drwaws similarity is when <strong>Carol/Max</strong> talks to Judith and Ira. As Max/Carol leaves Judith
          yells at him to comeback, showing the aggressive parenting style that Max's mom showed earlier in the movie. The last major thing linking the two is again positioning at the end. Judith stands next to Ira and KW, who both also represent
          real people. She also puts her arm around Alexander, who I concluded to represent Max. This is isimlar to how Max hugs his Mom when he returns home, showiung the caring side of both Judith and the Mom.
