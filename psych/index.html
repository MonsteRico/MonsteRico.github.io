                <h1 class="text-light">Max</h1>
                <p class="card-text text-light"> I believe that the main human characters of the movie don't represent a particular thing or idea. Instead they all show different concepts or themes related to child development. Throughout the movie
                  we see Max
                  go through a number of
                  character changes, along with seeing him move through Ericksons model on child development. Max starts in an early childhood mindset of initiative vs. guilt, where family is important, and where a major thing kids do is explore.
                  This
                  is exemplified by Max's exploration of the island throughout the movie and his desire to keep learning new things. When Max and the Wild Things are in a pile and Max is talking to KW, she comments, "You ask a lot of questions",
                  showing some of Max's curiosity. The next stage we see Max in is middle childhood, where a major theme is school. We don't see much of Max acting in this stage. We only see him in a classroom for one scene, where he learns that
                  the
                  sun will die and not everything lasts forever. The last major stage we see Max start to go through is adoolescence. Mainly, we see Max struggle to determine exactly how he should act and who he is. Towards the beginning of the
                  movei,
                  Max says "they think I'm a bad person...I don't know". However as themovei progresses we see Max gain a sense of identity. In the end, when asked by Carol "What are you?", Max replies "I'm Max". Throughout the movie, Max shows the
                  different stages of Erickson's theory on child development.</p>

                <h1 class="text-light">Carol</h1>
                <p class="card-text text-light">I believe that Carol is one representation of Max on the island. Carol represents Max towards the start of the movie, the more anger/emotionally driven irrational side of him. At the beginning, when
                  Max
                  arrives to the island we see Carol
                  destorying houses, very similar to how Max destroyed his sisters room. We also see Carol interact with his Wild Thing family much in the same way Max interacted with ihs own family. One example is a parallel drawn between kW and
                  Max's
                  sister. Carol is mad at KW for spenidng so much time with her friends, which is why he destroys their homes. Similarly, Max get's mad at his sister because her and her friends iddn't want to hang out with him. As a result he
                  destroys her
                  room. Another thing the two have in common is in some of the things they say. The movie does a good job of making it very obvious the two are linked, for example having Carol tell a story about teeth falling out that is very
                  similar
                  to the
                  one Max told his mom. There are multiple other examples like this throughout the movie. Carol gives Max a way to see how he affects others, due to their similiarity. Carol gives Max a lok at himself that he otherwise never would
                  have had.</p>

                <h1 class="text-light">Alexander</h1>
                <p class="card-text text-light">Alexander was a harder character to come up with a representation for. One possible conclusion is that he represents a different part of Max. Whereas Carol is the very irrational, outspoken, and
                  emotional side of Max, Alexander is the
                  shy, more quiet, scared side of Max. This is first shown in a comment towards the beginning of the movei, where Alexanders says quietly "Does anbody ever hear me?", showing Alexander as too scared to speak up for himself and
                  quiet.
                  This
                  is sort of reminiscent of how Max seemed to be in class, quiet and scared of what his teacher was saying. It's almost as if Alexander represents what Max thinks he should bel ike whereas Carol represents what Max is really like.
                  Alexander
                  is also shown to be pretty smart in how he deduced that Max "[isn't] really a king [he's] just regular". The biggest reason I think Alexander is really another aspect of Max is his positioning at the end. Alexander stands with
                  Ira,
                  KW,
                  and Judith, all of which I believe also represent real people. This leads me to belive that Alexander <i>also</i> represents a real person. Also at the very end, Judith puts her arm around Alexander in a caring way, ismilar to how
                  a
                  mother wraps her arm around a child. Alexander also shows finidng fault in authority figures when he realizes that Max isn't a king.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-light">Max's sister shows the more older side of child development. She obviously doesn't like to listen to her mother, shown when she ignores her moms request to come set teh table. She also seems to have
                  little relationship with Max in the sense
                  that she doesn't hang with him as much as her own friends. One of the phases on Erickson's model has to do with friends and social groups at around the age Max's sister appears to be. Another major part of Max's sister is how she
                  spends
                  more
                  time with her friends than Max. Max also doesn't understand her friends and how they act or why his sister like them so much. This is important in shwing the ocnnection between the sister and KW</p>

                <p class="card-text text-light">KW sometimes acts like a mom in the beginning. However, as teh movie progresses, it becomes increasilngly clear that KW is a representaiton of the sister. The first proof of this is how both spend
                  tiem
                  with their friends. Carol really
                  doesn't like that KW spends more time with her riends than with him, and Max is the same way with his sister. When KW introduces Max and Carol to these friends, neither Max nor Carol understands them. This directly connnects to
                  how
                  Max
                  doesn't understnad his sister's friends. The last major reason I believe KW to be a representation of the sister is due to her positioning at the end. She is with Ira, Judith, and Alexander, who I blieve represent the real people
                  in
                  Max's
                  life.</p>

                <h1 class="text-light">The Mom</h1>
                <p class="card-text text-light">The Mom exemplifies the parenting styles shown in the movie. In the beginning, she is shown to be a very busy person, telling Max, "I would've done something" about the sister's friends breaking his
                  fort. She is clearly not always there for
                  Max when he needs it as a developing child. Her investment into work is later shown when Max does a robot dance for her while she's on the computer, presumably working. Her attitued at this point in the movie to me shows a little
                  neglect.
                  The next major scene with her is the dinner scene when Max runs away. Here she shows aggressiveness, yelling at Max to get off the table, which ends up causing Max to fight/talk back. In this scene she is very clearly more focused
                  on her
                  date than Max, which is a part of what causes Max to act out. The Mom also shows a lot of regret and feels sorry after she causes Max to run away. At the end of the movie, even without dialogue, you can tell by the look on her
                  face
                  that she
                  is sorry. She rightly blames herself for Max running away. In the very last part she falls asleep, finally knowing that Max is safe at home. Her reaction to Max running away and his return shows a very protective and worried
                  parenting
                  style, who just wants to keep their kids safe.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-light">Judith very obviously represents the Mom. Judith is the other of two girls on the island, and the Mom and Sister (who appears to be connected to KW) are the two girls in Max's life. In the beginning
                  it
                  is mentioned that she and Ira are
                  in love, which is likely representative of the Moms relationship with the boyfriend. Both characters are even played by the same actor, which sohws that even the director/caster wanted to draw the connection between them. One
                  scene
                  that
                  draws similarity is when they are choosing teams for the dirtball fight. Max chooses both Judith and Ira to be bad guys. This is likely due to Max putting his mother on the bad side when he went against her and left home. The mom
                  also
                  didn't help Max in his snowball fight, so Judith not helping during the dirtball fight shows further similarity. Another scene that drwaws similarity is when <strong>Carol/Max</strong> talks to Judith and Ira. As Max/Carol leaves
                  Judith
                  yells at him to comeback, showing the aggressive parenting style that Max's mom showed earlier in the movie. The last major thing linking the two is again positioning at the end. Judith stands next to Ira and KW, who both also
                  represent
                  real people. She also puts her arm around Alexander, who I concluded to represent Max. This is isimlar to how Max hugs his Mom when he returns home, showiung the caring side of both Judith and the Mom.</p>

                  distracted by the date and ends up yelling at
                  Max, which is what cuases him to leave. The boyfriend is very quiet the entire time, making on ecomment saying "you know he can't talk to you that wat". This shows another kind of parenting style, even though the boyfriend isn't
                  really a
                  parental figure for Max.</p>

                  Judith
                  and "in love" with Judith, I see him
                  as the Boyfriend. Ira is also very quiet, and from the little we saw of the boyfriend he is also quiet. The last reason I believe this is because Ira is put on the bad guys team in the dirtball war, alongside Judith. Max sees both
                  his Mom
                  and her new Boyfriend as bad guys and therefore sees Ira as a bad guy. Ira is also positioned with Judith, Alexander, and KW who again, represent real people.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-light">The father is an interesting character to talk about, seeing as he's not even in the movie. The Dad is out of the picture whether it be due to divorce or death. It is clear however, that he had a good
                  relationship with Max. The main reason
                  for this is because of the globe that he had given to Max at some point. The globe says on it something akin to "To Max, from Dad". The Father also likely had a different parenting style from the Mom, but there isn't much to prove
                  this.</p>

                <p class="card-text text-light">The Bull was another hard character to place. Mainly because he only does three things throughout the entire movie. My conclusion is that he is also representative of teh Father. The first reason is
                  that he gives Max the scepter and
                  crown at the beginning. This is reminiscent of how a father would enable their childs imagination, giving them the things that they need to have fun. Max's dad also gave Max gifts, one of which was a globe. Throughout the movie,
                  the
                  Bull
                  is often quiet and separated from everyone else. Just like how Max's dad is no longer in Max's life and is separated somehow. At the end of the movie, the Bull is there, but separate from everyone else. Max's Dad also was absent
                  throughout somem of Max's life. He still exists but he and Max are separated, just like the Bull and everyone else.</p>

                <h1 class="text-light">Douglas</h1>
                <p class="card-text text-light">Douglas is the last hard character to place. He doesn't seem to directly represent a real person in Max's life, but he also isn't representative of any part of Max. I came to the conclusion that
                  Douglas
                  sort of represnts the Dad. In the
                  beginning of the movie he is seen trying to calm down Carol, similar to how a father would calm down his son. When Carol finds out Max isn't really a king, he get's mad at everyone for not telling him. Douglas responds with, "We
                  only went
                  along with it for you" which is a fatherly thing to do. Douglas also says he is proud of Carol for doing the right thing and not getting back at KW during the dirtball fight. All of these things show a good relationship between
                  Carol and
                  Douglas, like I believe Max had with his father. When picking teams for the dirtball fight, Carol says to Douglas, "of coures you're on my team, you're a good guy". Lastly Douglas isn't with the "real people" characters at thend,
                  showing
                  that he's not directly in Max's life. Just like the Dad, who was at some point but no longer is part of Max's life.</p>

                <h1 class="text-light">Bob and Terry</h1>
                <p class="card-text text-light">Bob and Terry clearly represent the sisters friends. Firstly, they are KW's friends who Carol does not like. Kiw is a representation of the sister and Carol is Max, so it stands to reason that KW's
                  friends, Bob and Terry, would reperesnt
                  the sisters friends. When KW brings Max to see Bob & Terry, he doesn't understand them at all. This is similar to how Max doesn't understand his sisters friends. Lastly, KW offers for Max to see Bob & Terry for some advice. When
                  Max
                  asks
                  them for help, they don't offer him any real advice, because he can't understand them. This is reminiscent of a scene in the beginning. The sisters friends destroy Max's snow fort, leaving Max in the snow remaining. As they get in
                  the car
                  to leave, one of her friends looks back to check on Max, and looks like he is thinking about helping Max. The sister pulls him back into thecar, leaving Max confused and helpless. This is almost exactly the same as the advice Bob
                  &
                  Terry
                  give. It leaves Max confused and without help.</p>

          <h2>What is the major conflict of the movie?</h2>
          <p class="card-text">The major conflict of the movie is Max running away and his fight with his mom. Firstly, this is an obvious conflict. Max andhis Mom are at odds with each other, with Max not wanting to do what is asked of him. Next,
            without this scene occurring the rest of the movie would never happen. This scene is the critical point that really se'ts Max onto his journey. The idea of this conflict is also echoed multiple times throughout the movie. For exmample,
            when Judith, who represents the Mom, is yelling at Max to come back and Max doesn't. It is a very similar conflict to Max vs his Mother. The last reason for this to be the mejor conflict is because it clearly gets resolved at the end.
            Max
            and his Mom reunite, with both looking very sorry for what they did. Even without dialogue, the scene shows that the conflict between the two has been resolved. This is further shown when the Mom falls asleep, trusting Max to not leave
            again.</p>

          <h2>What does the title mean?</h2>
          <p class="card-text">The title likely refers to the island and the creatues living on it. It also refers to how the Wild Things are likely just Max's imaginiation. All of them are his own interpretations of different people, both
            consciously and subconciously. For example, Carol acts exactly like Max does. The "Where" refers to the setting. It's the island that Max ends up on. However, it is never fully explained if Max <i>actually</i> went to an island or if it
            was all his imagination. I personally think that Max somehow did get to and from the island, and that the Wild Things were just his defense mechanism against being alone. The title is "Where the Wild Things Are" because the movie is
            about
            Max, and it's in his head that the Wild Things are really located.</p>

          <p class="card-text">I really liked the movie. I enjoyed it's big characters and the personalities they had. I also liked seeing the connections show up between the WIld Things and the people in Max's life. I thought the story was really
            well done and defninitely gets it's point across. I don't remember reading the booko, although I'm sure I did, but the movie seemed to be a good representation from the little I've seen or remembered of the book. The way the Wild Things
            were created and filmed is also very impressive to me. Overall, the movie was good. I might not have watched it on my own, even when I was younger, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.</p>
