    <h3 class="text-center">Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Internet was started in America as a project by the military. It’s main use would have been to keep the country connected in case of nuclear warfare changing the country during the Cold War. It turned out to develop into something far
      greater, with a much bigger impact than anyone could have expected. The Internet may have started in America, but it changed the way the entire world functioned.

              <p>The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), a bureau of the Department of Defense, was created to try and stay one-step ahead of the Soviets during the Cold War. Some researchers at ARPA looked into a way to connect computers
                together and to share information across computers. In 1969, they finally figured it out. ARPANET was created as a way to share access to supercomputers to researchers throughout America. It became the foundation that the Internet was
                built off of. Once the connection of computers was possible, it became commercialized and began to grow into the Internet we know today.</p>

              <p>Originally, ARPANET could only transfer files between computers. Raymond S. Tomlinson changed that by creating e-mail. In 1972, he took his code that he “developed the code for e-mail on his own time, for fun” (Baughman, et al.) and
                made it usable on ARPANET. It quickly became popular with all of ARPANET’s users as it allowed for easy communication and collaboration on research projects. When the Internet eventually became more public, email was used by many
                users
                of the Internet.</p>

              <p>Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn teamed up to create TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), a set of rules that set a standard for all computers and networks to follow. A decade later, it was adopted as the universal
                standard for all networks to come. This helped push the Internet into what we know today.</p>

              <p>Many companies developed their own networks based off of ARPANET, allowing individuals to gain access to the Internet. ARPANET was eventually shut down in 1990, leaving behind it’s connection of networks that became the Internet.
                Also in 1990, although not in America, Tim Berners Lee developed a way to make using the Internet easier. He made the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as well as HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which is the code webpages (like
                this one!) are written in. These things combine to make the World Wide Web, a way for users of the Internet to access documents easily.

              <p>Back in America, at the University of Illinois, Marc Andreessen made a web browser with a better, easier to understand, graphical interface. The browser was much easier to use then the text-based ones that had existed previously.
                This was quickly adopted by all users of the Internet and led to “the World Wide Web [growing] by 341,000 percent” (Baughman, et al.). Microsoft followed soon after with the creation of Internet Explorer. Both of these browsers were
                predecessors to the ones we use today to browse the Internet.

              <p>As the Internet and it’s ease of use grew, companies began to pop up. Known as dot-coms, these companies helped contribute to the economic boom that came from the Internet. Stock prices of new dot-coms increased very quickly, making
                many of the new companies very rich very fast. Many big name companies on the Internet, such as Amazon, eBay, and Yahoo, started to become big from this time.</p>

                name websites and online services started showing up, like YouTube, MySpace, and Wikipedia. The Internet quickly evolved into what we know today.</p>

    <h3>Significance</h3>
    <p class="text-left pb-5">The Internet and it’s creation is significant to American history due to how it changed the course of history moving forward. The Internet fundamentally changed the way many Americans lived. It has “[become] a central
      feature
      in the daily
      lives of more than a billion people” (Benson, Sonia, et al). The Internet has also led to growth in the economy. Just like “railroads and electricity in the late nineteenth century, the Web has created a new economic era” (Benson, Sonia, et
      al). Without the Internet or the people who brought the idea to life, the world would be very different.
    </p>
    <h3>Impact on America and the World</h3>
    <p class="text-left pb-5">The made the world more connected. At any moment you can get information from Europe in America. It led to new opportunities for businesses to grow. It also led to an economic boom for America, with
      all of
      the new eCommerce
      sites bringing a lot of customers to the Internet. However, with all the good things came some bad. The Internet is something that can also be used as a tool to spread misinformation or to do malicious things. The Internet definitely made an
      impact on the way things work in our world, leading to many changes in the daily lives of people everywhere.</p>
