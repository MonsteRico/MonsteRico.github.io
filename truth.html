					<h4 class="text-center cardHead">The Beginning</h4>
					<p class="cardText">Pyramids & Sphinx were not buildt by the Egyptians 4,000 years ago like historians say. They were built by a advanced civilization that lived over 12 thousand years ago. That advanced civiliization was destroyed by the aftermath of meteor impact in Greenland.</p>

					<h4 class="text-center cardHead">Stonhenge</h4>
					<p class="cardText">Stonehenge could be a portal but because of some of the stones are missing it's hard to figure out. Not only that theres evidence of more henges. Maybe they were part of a city/colony but with the meteor they were wiped out.</p>
